* Convert duplicate options to use a DuplicateOptionsCollection which offers
  easier #to_ini handling, as well as returning the last value when calling
  #to_s (not to mention getting rid of all this #kind_of?(Array) stuff).

* Support quoted values such that +key = "a value"+ becomes "a value" but is
  correctly written back to the file with quotes intact.

* Support multi-line options with backslashes (presumably with
  OptionCollection).
