# iniparse
### A Ruby library for parsing INI files.

This rubygem is in ongoing development and is most certainly not ready for use
in _any_ situation at the moment.

You should check out the inifile gem which may provide what you need.

IniParse will be a Ruby library for parsing and writing to INI files. The
library aims to achieve similar goals to the Python library of the same name.

In particular:

* Preservation of non-trailing whitespace and blank lines.
* Support for duplicate options.
* Preservation of section and option ordering.
* (maybe-perhaps) Support for multi-line options with backslashes.

### Dependencies

* rubygems
* extlib
